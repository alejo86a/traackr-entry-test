# Traackr entry test

This is my proposed solution for the exercise. It was tested with the given file as an example and it worked fine. In addition, a script 'fill-script.js' was defined that with random strings can emulate the file up to 1GB in size. Below are the instructions for running the exercise.

If you want to change the parameters for the application, in the index.js file line 8 is the path of the file to test and line 9 is the number of modified names to generate

### first install the dependencies 
`npm i`

### Execute test
the unit tests will verify that the functions that contain the algorithms work correctly

`npm run test`

### Run with test file
To run the application immediately run the following command. in the same console you will see the results of the process

`npm run start`

### Create a large file to test
to create a large file to test run the following command, also don't forget to change the parameter on line 8 before running the application again

`npm run fill`
